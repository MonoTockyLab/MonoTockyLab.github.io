### Fluorescent Timer Protein

As a BBSRC David Phillips Fellow, Dr. Ono developed a novel experimental method for analyzing the temporal changes in cellular activities and differentiation through flow cytometric analysis using a Fluorescent Timer protein, which was developed by the Verkhusha group ([Subach et al., 2009](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19136976/)). This Fluorescent Timer protein is an mCherry mutant (_fastFT_).

The chromophore of the Fluorescent Timer protein emits blue fluorescence upon translation, which then matures into red chromophore with a half-life of 4 hours. This maturation process was [experimentally determined](https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.15252/embj.201899013) through flow cytometric analysis of T-cells expressing the Timer protein {% cite RN56 %}.

### From Timer to Tocky: A New Perspective

With the Tocky reporter system, each cell expresses multiple Timer proteins. The expression dynamics are determined by the temporal dynamics of transcriptional activities for the Timer gene.

Thus, each cell will express multiple Timer proteins, each maturing from the blue form to the red one. This creates a continuous gradient of Timer fluorescence from blue to red {% cite RN55 %}.

As flow cytometry is a single-cell analysis method, the unique features of Timer fluorescence and Timer-expressing cells provide opportunities to dissect the temporal dynamics of cellular activities and differentiation.

This requires quantitative analysis. Enter the quantitative Timer fluorescence analysis method - Tocky.

Hence, the pivotal element that defines Tocky is the shift from protein-level analysis to **single-cell level analysis**.
