#### Transitioning from Molecular Immunology to Systems Immunology

Until 2007, I focused on the molecular biology of Treg, publishing seminal papers for the Foxp3-Runx1 interaction {% cite RN23 %}.

    </div>
</div>


However, upon realising the fundamental problem with Treg, I chose an unconventional path - extending my expertise to computational biology💻, which would become pivotal in developing Tocky.

#### First Independent Studies in Kyoto

As I was promoted to Assistant Professsor in 2007, I secured grant support from [the Kato Foundation](https://www.katokinen.or.jp/info/4_2english.html) in 2008 for my first transcriptome analysis using microarray 🧬. 

However, the complexity of the data was overwhelming, challenging the simplistic analytical methods of the time.

#### The Lack of Appropriate Methods

Back then in 2006 - 2007, immunology papers mainly used simple methods like [log2 fold change only](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16772372/), which was not convincing to me.

#### Exploration and Collaborations in Kyoto

Thus, in 2008, I aimed to develop more sophisticated methods for immunological genomic analysis, identifying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as a promising candidate 🤔🔍. 

In 2008, [Dr Manabu Kano](https://www.twitter.com/Dr_Kano), an expert in PCA in Eng. Dept, Kyoto Univ, provided invaluable guidance, teaching me mathematical foundations of PCA in data analysis. 
This collaboration was a pivotal step in my journey to redefine Treg in a data-oriented manner🎓💡. 

In addition, [Prof Toshio Sugiman](https://www.twitter.com/toshsugi), an expert in psychometrics🧠📈, introduced me to Hayashi's Quantification Method III, a tool for quantifying [group relationships in psychology](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/acrt1992/1/1/1_1_17/_article). 
Hayashi's statistical philosophy profoundly inspired me, and this will lead to the development of the groundbreaking method five years later.

#### Extending Research Fields: From Kyoto to the UK.

Aiming to adapt Hayashi's method and PCA for genomic data in immunology, I obtained an HFSP fellowship and thereby moved from Kyoto🇯🇵 to UCL🇬🇧 , eventually led to [the development of Canonical Correspondence Analysis, originally by ter Braak, for genomics](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0053544) {% cite RN98 %}.

</div>

🔬Canonical Correspondence Analysis is an efficient method for [qunatitative anlaysis of cell phenotype and gene activities, focusing on certain biological processes]((https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-15-1028). In addition, it can classify cells using a machine learning approach {% cite RN97 %}🧬💻.

#### The Journey to Tocky is Through CCA

Importantly, CCA was utilized to identify [Nr4a3 as the best correlate to TCR signalling](https://rupress.org/jcb/article/217/8/2931/39442/A-timer-for-analyzing-temporally-dynamic-changes), which was a key step in developing Nr4a3-Tocky {% cite RN55 %} 🐭🔬.
