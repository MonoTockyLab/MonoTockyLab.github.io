#### Transitioning from molecular immunology to systems immunology
Until 2007, I focused on the molecular biology of Treg, publishing seminal papers such as [Ono et al 2007](https://nature.com/articles/nature05673). 

However, upon realising [the fundamental problem with Treg](), I chose an unconventional path - extending my expertise to computational biology💻, which would become pivotal in developing Tocky.

#### First independent studies in Kyoto
As I was promoted to Assistant Professsor in 2007, I secured grant support from [the Kato Foundation](https://katokinen.or.jp/info/4_2english.html) in 2008 for my first transcriptome analysis using microarray 🧬. 

However, the complexity of the data was overwhelming, challenging the simplistic analytical methods of the time.

#### The lack of appropriate methods
Back then in 2006 - 2007, immunology papers mainly used simple methods like [log2 fold change only](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16772372/), which was not convincing to me.

#### Exploration and collaborations in Kyoto

Thus, in 2008, I aimed to develop more sophisticated methods for immunological genomic analysis, identifying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as a promising candidate 🤔🔍. 

In 2008, [Dr Manabu Kano](https://www.twitter.com/Dr_Kano), an expert in PCA in Eng. Dept, Kyoto Univ, provided invaluable guidance, teaching me mathematical foundations of PCA in data analysis. 
This collaboration was a pivotal step in my journey to redefine Treg in a data-oriented manner🎓💡. 


In addition, [Prof Toshio Sugiman](https://www.twitter.com/toshsugi), an expert in psychometrics🧠📈, introduced me to Hayashi's Quantification Method III, a tool for quantifying [group relationships in psychology](https://jstage.jst.go.jp/article/acrt1992/1/1/1_1_17/_article). 
Hayashi's statistical philosophy profoundly inspired me.

#### Moving to the UK for extensing my research fields

Aiming to adapt Hayashi's method and PCA for genomic data in immunology, I obtained an HFSP fellowship and thereby moved from Kyoto🇯🇵 to UCL🇬🇧 , eventually led to the development of Canonical Correspondence Analysis, originally by ter Braak, for genomics by 2013 ([Ono et al, 2013](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0053544)).

    </div>
</div>

🔬Canonical Correspondence Analysis is an efficient method for visualising cell-cell similarities, focusing on certain biological processes, and can classify cells using a machine learning approach, as demonstrated in [Ono et al 2014](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-15-1028).🧬💻

#### The journey to Tocky is through CCA

Importantly, CCA was utilized to identify Nr4a3 as the best correlate to TCR signalling, which was a key step in developing [Nr4a3-Tocky](https://rupress.org/jcb/article/217/8/2931/39442/A-timer-for-analyzing-temporally-dynamic-changes) 🐭🔬.
