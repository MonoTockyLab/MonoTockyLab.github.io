Around the same time, I launched a new cancer immunotherapy project that utilized the capabilities of Tocky technology.</p> <h3 id="a-pump-priming-collaborative-grant-2017">A Pump Priming Collaborative Grant 2017</h3> <p>In 2016, I initiated discussions about a new cancer immunotherapy project with my collaborators at the Institute for Cancer Research, Prof Alan Melcher and Prof Kevin Harrington.</p> <p>These discussions led to securing a pump-priming grant from the <em>Cancer Research Centre of Excellence</em> (CRCE, now known as the <em>CRUK Convergence Science Centre</em>). The grant, which was for a one-year project starting in September 2017, marked a significant milestone. It enabled us to commence a project focused on investigating the effects of immune checkpoint blockade on cancer-reactive T cells, utilizing tools such as Nr4a3-Tocky and Foxp3-Tocky.</p> <h3 id="a-phd-studentship-2019">A PhD studentship 2019</h3> <p>The next stage of our cancer research endeavor involved applying for a PhD studentship from the Convergence Science Centre to study immune checkpoint inhibitors, specifically PD-1 blockade.

Usual T cells induce immune response when they recognise their target. However, Tregs can suppress immune response. Thus the current theory is that Tregs are a special type of T cells, functioning to maintain immune system balance and prevent autoimmune diseases, where the body attacks its own cells.</p> <p>However, these T cells aren’t as unique as people believe. This is illustrated in the catastrophic clinical trial for the world-first clinical trial, TGN1412 <a class="citation" href="#RN58">(Bending &amp; Ono, 2018)</a>.</p> <h4 id="the-clinical-trial">The Clinical Trial</h4> <p>The significance of understanding T cells’ dynamics in vivo is illuminated by the clinical trial of TGN1412 in 2006. TGN1412, a superagonistic anti-CD28 antibody intended to suppress autoimmune reactions, instead caused severe inflammation known as a “cytokine storm” in volunteers.</p> <h4 id="turning-point">Turning Point</h4> <p>TGN1412 is a superagonistic anti-CD28 antibody designed to activate T cells directly, eliminating the need for anti-CD3 antibodies. Initially, it was developed with the goal of activating and restoring the T-cell repertoire in leukaemia patients. However, following promising results from animal studies, TGN1412 was later repurposed as an immunosuppressant. These studies showed that the anti-CD28 stimulation selectively activated regulatory T cells (Tregs) and effectively suppressed immune response.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0 text-center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/tgn1412/tgn1412-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/tgn1412/tgn1412-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/tgn1412/tgn1412-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/tgn1412/tgn1412.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="600" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption" style="text-align: center;"> Summary of Research and Development Strategies for TGN1412. </div> <h4 id="investigations-and-reflections">Investigations and Reflections</h4> <p>Investigations into the incident concluded that it was an unfortunate and unforeseeable event due to the different expression dynamics of CD28 between humans and primates, which were used in the pre-clinical stage of the drug development.</p> <p>However, as discussed in Vitetta and Ghetie (2006), Tregs and non-Tregs may not represent strictly separate lineages. Therefore, the assumption of specifically activating only a minor population may have been inappropriate.</p> <p>It is worth remembering that the first lecture in T cell biology always begins with T cell receptor signaling and CD28 signaling. Without CD28 signaling, T cells cannot be fully activated, as CD28 signaling is a strong activating signal for all T cells.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0 text-center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/tgn1412/tcellactivation-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/tgn1412/tcellactivation-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/tgn1412/tcellactivation-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/tgn1412/tcellactivation" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="600" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption" style="text-align: center;"> Adapted from My Lecture Slide for Introducting T-cell Biology. </div> <p>This disaster underscored the importance of understanding the roles and activation mechanisms of T cells in general, not just focusing on Treg cells alone.</p> <h4 id="foxp3-and-the-lieage-perspective">Foxp3 and the Lieage Perspective</h4> <p>Asano <em>et al</em> set the stage for the lineage perspective of Treg by highlighting CD25+CD4+ T cells as a “<em>naturally differentiated, unique T cell subset originating in the thymus</em>.” My other article showed that this perspective was not supported by reproducible evidence at the time.</p> <p>However, the subsequent development in immunology—the discovery of Foxp3—fit well with the stage set by Asano <em>et al</em>. Foxp3, as a transcription factor specifically expressed by CD25+CD4+ T cells, was defined as the lineage-determinant factor of Tregs.</p> <p>It is true that Foxp3 is key in controlling the development and function of suppressive T cells. However, by defining Foxp3 as the lineage factor, we overlook an essential aspect of T cells – their dynamic nature and changing properties.</p> <h4 id="treg-plasticity-or-changing-t-cells">Treg Plasticity or Changing T cells?</h4> <p>Recent studies have highlighted the plasticity of Tregs—that is, their ability to change under certain conditions. For example, during inflammation, Tregs can lose their Foxp3 expression and transform into effector T cells, which actively respond to pathogens. This plasticity is crucial because it demonstrates that Tregs can adapt based on the body’s needs, potentially shifting roles from regulators to attackers.</p> <p>However, by categorizing these changes as Treg <em>plasticity</em>, studies remain trapped and constrained by the lineage perspective. Indeed, many researchers and pharmaceutical companies are pursuing the development of a method to produce ‘stable’ Tregs.</p> <p><strong>What if Foxp3 is inherently a dynamic molecule? Is it an effective approach to pursue the stable Treg as a holy grail?</strong></p> <h4 id="from-stability-to-dynamics">From Stability To Dynamics</h4> <p>Revealing the principles of Foxp3 as a dynamic mechanism could significantly improve our ability to control the T cell system. However, this cannot be achieved if studies remain constrained by the lineage perspective that originated with Asano et al.</p> <p>Studying the dynamic changes in Tregs during immune responses is crucial for a deeper understanding of immune regulation. Innovative tools like the Tocky system, which tracks cell kinetics and activity, are enabling researchers to explore how Tregs and their Foxp3 expression change in real-time. These insights are vital for developing effective immunotherapies.</p> <p>Understanding the dynamics of Foxp3 and Treg activity provides a window into the sophisticated mechanisms of immune regulation. This knowledge is not only fundamental to the field of immunology but also crucial for developing new treatments for immune-related diseases.</p> <p>Investigating Foxp3 as a dynamic molecule and the dynamics of T cells in vivo within a broader context will be a fundamental approach not only for understanding T cell biology but also for developing future immunotherapies.</p> <p>The contents of this article are discussed in detail in <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cei/article/197/1/14/6402549">my paper published in 2019</a>.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0 text-center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/tgn1412/newton-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/tgn1412/newton-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/tgn1412/newton-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/tgn1412/newton.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="400" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <hr/>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog"/><category term="self-reactivity"/><category term="t-cells"/><category term="treg"/><category term="tgn1412"/><category term="immunotherapy"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[lessons from the first treg immunotherapy trial]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">professionalism and official account integrity</title><link href="https://monotockylab.github.io/blog/2024/dermatology/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="professionalism and official account integrity"/><published>2024-06-01T16:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-06-01T16:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://monotockylab.github.io/blog/2024/dermatology</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://monotockylab.github.io/blog/2024/dermatology/"><![CDATA[<h4 id="1-memories-of-dermatology">1.

Considering that <a href="https://x.com/jdakyoto">the official account</a> is operated by the Dermatology Department of Kyoto University, which is responsible for managing the 2024 annual meeting, I am compelled to question whether the conference itself is being managed in a similar manner.</p> <p>Thus, <a href="https://x.com/masahirono/status/1791765101524984073">I have once again asked the official account to reconsider</a>.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <a href="https://x.com/masahirono/status/1791765101524984073"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/jda/tweet2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/jda/tweet2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/jda/tweet2-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/jda/tweet2.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="400" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </a> </div> </div> <p>Below is a summary of the main issues concerning the operation of the official Twitter account:</p> <p>1) <strong>A lack of consideration about how their actions appear publicly.</strong> The tweets to date have been sufficient to erode trust not only in the conference but in dermatologists in general from the public, such as patients.</p> <p>2) <strong>The official account, bearing the JDA’s logo and name, has been utilized for non-official purposes.</strong> These include promoting book sales by an individual from Kyoto University, which is responsible for the Annual Meeting 2024 and the official Twitter account, and introducing products sold by a dermatologist who apparently has a cozy relationship with the account.</p> <p>3) <strong>The official account was masquerading as a ‘funny event account’ or ‘Yuru-chara mascot’, ostensibly to justify its inappropriate content and stance.</strong> However, socially inappropriate actions cannot be justified under such pretenses.</p> <p>Thus, these issues are related to management and governance, and the responsibility lies with the president of the Annual Meeting, Professor Kenji Kabashima of Kyoto University, and his management team.</p> <p>I believe that most members of the Dermatology Association will attend the conference, temporarily pausing their practices, just as I did 23 years ago. Many may need to do so to renew their specialist qualifications. I am confident that many members engage earnestly in the academic pursuit of dermatology. I hope the conference management team does not disappoint these dedicated professionals.</p> <p><strong>Note:</strong> This blog article was translated from a Japanese blog post originally published on May 18, 2024.

Today, I want to highlight a crucial factor that guided my research direction and sparked my initial motivation to develop Tocky.</p> <hr/> <h4 id="encountering-with-the-problem">Encountering with the Problem</h4> <p>Launching my PhD at Sakaguchi lab in 2002, I focused on GITR as a potentially useful Treg marker (note this was pre-Foxp3 era). I aimed to replicate early Treg experiments, including the milestone paper <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8760792/">Asano et al., J Exp Med 1996</a> from Shimon Sakaguchi’s group.</p> <p>Asanot et al. claimed that CD25+ T cells do not appear before day 3 post-birth, which assertion was pivotal as it ‘proved’ that ‘depletion of Tregs’ by day 3 thymectomy caused autoimmunity.</p> <p>I obtained a disturbing finding in 2003 (my second year in PhD): substantial numbers of Tregs existed in the neonatal spleen and thymus as early as day 1 after birth. This finding starkly contradicted the key claim of the Treg milestone paper by Asano et al., 1996.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/asano/asano1-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/asano/asano1-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/asano/asano1-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/asano/asano1.jpg" width="500" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <hr/> <h4 id="confirming-the-non-reproducibility">Confirming the Non-Reproducibility</h4> <p>This finding was not isolated – <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.0403303101">Dujardin et al., PNAS, 2004</a> from the Bandeira group presented very similar data to what I had discovered.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/asano/asano2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/asano/asano2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/asano/asano2-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/asano/asano2.jpg" width="700" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <hr/> <h4 id="status-quo">Status Quo</h4> <p>At that time, I believed that the Treg theory, which relied heavily on the findings of Asano et al 1996, would soon be revised. Unfortunately, that has not happened.</p> <p>Many textbooks and reviews have echoed the findings of Asano et al, despite the evidence to the contrary regarding neonatal Treg dynamics. More recently, a milestone article on Treg by <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d42859-022-00048-z">Svoboda, Nature, 2022</a> still references the outdated notion as below.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/asano/asano3-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/asano/asano3-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/asano/asano3-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/asano/asano3.jpg" width="650" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <hr/> <h4 id="redefining-treg-research-beyond-the-boundaries">Redefining Treg Research: Beyond the Boundaries</h4> <p>This experience led me to scrutinize widely accepted papers and theories in the Treg field critically, convincing me that the Treg theories and concepts themselves needed substantial revision.</p> <p>This realization prompted my move from Japan to the UK in 2009 to extend my research and develop new tools to investigate Treg. This endevour resulted in the development of the multidimensional method Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) in genomics <a class="citation" href="#RN98">(Ono et al., 2013)</a> and Tocky <a class="citation" href="#RN55">(Bending et al., 2018)</a>.</p> <hr/> <h4 id="later-development">Later Development</h4> <p>The implications in the issues within Asano et al were profound. I later examined the effects of these and wrote a theoretical/opinion paper, analysing evidence from past papers and proposing a new perspective <a class="citation" href="#RN44">(Ono &amp; Tanaka, 2016)</a>.</p> <p>Further, given that the belief that Tregs constitute a unique lineage of cells originates from, and is supported by, the findings of <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8760792/">Asano et al.</a>, it is urgently required to establish a new research framework to investigate Foxp3 and Treg, without relying on the idea of a <em>stable lineage</em>.</p> <p>Our second Tocky publication published in the EMBO Journal <a class="citation" href="#RN56">(Bending et al., 2018)</a> investigated temporal dynamics of Foxp3 transcription and thereby addressed this challenge.</p> <hr/>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog"/><category term="treg"/><category term="thymectomy"/><category term="motivation"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[reexamining treg fundmentals]]></summary></entry></feed>
