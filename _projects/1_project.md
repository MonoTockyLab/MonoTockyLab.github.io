#### Masahiro Ono launched his innovative project to develop a completely new methodology to analyse the time domain of T cell activities using a Fluorescent Timer protein - **T**imer-**o**f-**c**ell-**k**inetics-and-activit**y** (**Tocky**) in 2013. 

This resulted in a [seminal publication](https://rupress.org/jcb/article/217/8/2931/39442/A-timer-for-analyzing-temporally-dynamic-changes) in 2018 {% cite RN55 %}.

#### Discovery of Nr4a3 as a faithful reporter gene for cognate antigen signalling

After launching my own laboratory at University College London, I started to develop a completely novel approach for understanding T-cell dynamics in vivo.

Using Canonical Correspondence Analysis, Nr4a3 was identified as the gene that showed the highest correlation to T-cell receptor (TCR) signalled T-cells in the thymus and the periphery. 

Importantly, Nr4a3 is not expresssed in resting T-cells or B-cells. However, antigen signalling (precisely, cognate antigen signalling) induces Nr4a3 expression in both T-cells and B-cells.

#### Development of Nr4a3-Timer reporter mice (Nr4a3-Tocky)

The conception of the Timer method was followed by my isolated lab project - I worked on my own without recruiting any staff to fully use the time and resource for developing a new animal model.

The Bacterial Artificial Chromosome approach was used by several reasons (which I will show in a future post) to develop Nr4a3-Timer reporter mice, *Nr4a3-Tocky*. Fortunately, I had a very good experience in developing transgenic mouse strains in Japan.

Upon TCR stimulation, Nr4a3-Tocky T cells show initial timer blue fluorescence within the first hours, which then gradually matures into red fluorescence. This transition approaches the diagonal line between the Blue and Red axes, indicating protein maturation.

#### Development of the Tocky data analysis method

Timer fluorescence data are continuous - i.e. traditional gating approaches are not sufficient for fully using the power of Timer. Therefore, to quantitatively analyse Timer fluorescence data, Ono developed a novel trigonometric data transformation (Timer Angle) approach, which enables seamless analysis of T-cell dynamics from newlly indueced TCR signals (the Timer New locus) to the status of T-cells which have experienced TCR signalling and been removed from stimulation (the Arrested locus).

Tocky is a technology transforming our understanding of the immune system by tracking T cells' activity over time. This method, which uses a color-changing protein, has illuminated the path of T cell activation and differentiation, providing new insights into autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis. "Tocky" represents not just a milestone in immunology research but a beacon guiding us toward novel therapeutic horizons. It's a testament to the power of innovation in revealing the hidden dynamics of life at the cellular level.

The publication was featured in the journal's collection [*Stem Cells and Development 2019*](https://rupress.org/jcb/collection/41/Stem-Cells-and-Development-2019).
