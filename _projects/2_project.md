#### Foxp3 - a Lineage Factor or a Marker for Regulatory Function?

It is widely considered that Foxp3-expressing regulatory T cells (Treg) are a separate type of T-cells specialised for suppressing immune cell activities. Okay, this may be true if all Treg are functioning as suppressor T cells. However, in reality, it is difficult to identify which Treg cells are functioning and which ones are not. Further, the majority of Foxp3-expressing T-cells are not functional Treg and can contribute to the induction of T-cell response in humans {% cite RN47 RN24 RN29 %}.

Importantly, the belief that Tregs constitute a unique lineage of cells originates from, and is supported by, the findings of Asano et al. **Should this evidence [no longer be valid](https://monotockylab.github.io/blog/2024/reflections/) {% cite RN44 %}, how can we then investigate Foxp3 and Treg?**

Our second Tocky publication {% cite RN56 %} aimed to answer this question by demonstrating the power of Foxp3-Tocky – the Tocky mouse strain for monitoring temporal dynamics of Foxp3 transcription {% cite RN47 RN55 %}. Our results support that Foxp3 acts as a switch for the suppressive mechanism that is dynamically induced during homeostasis and upon stimulation.

#### Experimental Validation of Foxp3-Tocky

First, to better understand Foxp3 transcription dynamics, we experimentally determined the half-life of Fluorescent Timer protein. Using degradation assays, the half-life of blue fluorescence and red fluorescence was 4 h and 120 h, respectively. These are improved measurements, as previous reports relied on estimation through modelling.

#### Immunological Significance of Foxp3 Transcirptional Dynamics Revealed by Tocky

##### New Foxp3 Transcription

By analysing homeostasis and inflammation, we showed that Foxp3 expression is newly induced in a small yet significant percentage of CD4+ T-cells and that this is increased during self-containing inflammation. These results support more dynamic regulation of Foxp3 than previously imagined.

##### Persistent Foxp3 Transcription

Intriguingly, we found that temporally sustained Foxp3 transcription (_Persistent_ transcription) is a hallmark of activated Treg with enhanced immunoregulatory phenotype (_effector Treg_).

##### Autoregulatory Transcriptional Loop for Foxp3 Revealed by Tocky

The utilization of a triple transgenic system, combining _Foxp3-Tocky_, _Foxp3-EGFP_ knock-in, and _Foxp3 scurfy_ hypomorphic mutant loci, allowed for an unprecedented analysis of Foxp3 transcriptional regulation in the presence and absence of functional Foxp3 protein. This approach unveiled a significant finding: the Foxp3 protein itself amplifies the transcription of the Foxp3 gene, indicating an autoregulatory loop that enhances the regulatory functions of Foxp3.

##### Immunotherapy Application of Tocky

Understanding of temporally dynamic features of Foxp3 expressors enabled a new immunotherapy targeting Foxp3 dynamics. We demonstrated this using anti-OX40 antibody, which accelerated apoptosis of Foxp3 Persistent expressors.
