# Deciphering Temporal Dynamics in Cell Development: Introducing Our Multidimensional Toolkit Using Tocky Technology

**Date:** 1 December 2024  
**Author:** Masahiro Ono

I am thrilled to share groundbreaking developments from our latest research. Our study, titled **"A multidimensional toolkit for elucidating temporal trajectories in cell development in vivo,"** introduces an innovative computational tool that exploits the multidimensional power of our Tocky technology to decipher time-dependent processes in cellular development {% cite tockydev2024 %}.

## Background: Overcoming Challenges in Analyzing Temporal Dynamics of Developing Cells in Vivo

During cell development, progenitor cells respond to key signals by altering gene expression and phenotypes, initiating dynamic developmental processes. However, it is extremely challenging to capture these dynamic processes at the single-cell level in vivo, primarily due to the stochastic nature of signal transduction and the lack of adequate methodologies in both experimental and computational analysis.

## The Innovation: Tocky Technology and Multidimensional Analysis for High-Dimensional Flow Cytometric Timer Data

At the core of our approach is the **Tocky technology**, a tool that uses a Fluorescent Timer reporter gene to track the time elapsed since a cell receives a developmental cue. This technology comprises experimental Timer reporter systems and computational algorithms to analyze Timer data.

With advancements in cytometry technologies, the combined analysis of high-dimensional marker profiles and Timer fluorescence data can provide opportunities to fully integrate this temporal measurement with high-dimensional flow cytometric data. This approach allows for deciphering time-dependent changes during cell development, leveraging experimental data in a data-oriented manner.


## Solution: Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) Meets Flow Cytometry

A pivotal advancement in our toolkit is the application of **Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA)**, adapted to manage the complexities of flow cytometric data. CCA was originally developed by ecological statistician Cajol ter Braak. From 2009 to 2014, I recognized CCAâ€™s potential in genomics and developed it as a method for genomic analysis.

Now, for the first time, **CCA is adapted to high-dimensional flow cytometric analysis**, elucidating the time-dependent changes as retained in Timer fluorescence. This adaptation allows for the cross-analysis of Timer progression with the multifaceted marker profiles of cells, thus elucidating temporal trajectories of cellular development through time.

### A Novel Principal Component Analysis-Based Approach to Overcoming Stochasticity in Clustering

Autofluorescence in flow cytometry can obscure true signals, complicating data analysis. Our innovative **PrecisionPCAClustering** algorithm tackles this by distinguishing genuine marker expressions from background noise. This enhancement not only improves the accuracy of clustering but also preserves the continuity of developmental pathways, which is crucial for detailed trajectory analysis.

### Unveiling Developmental Trajectories with Dijkstra-Tocky Pathfinding

To further elucidate developmental pathways, we developed the novel **Dijkstra-Tocky pathfinding algorithm**, an adaptation that uses time-encoded data to trace the most probable paths of cell differentiation, considering Timer progression and multidimensional marker profiles. This technique has helped us discover distinct trajectories for CD4 single-positive T-cells, providing unprecedented insights into their differentiation processes.

## Case Study: Thymic T-Cell Development in Nr4a3-Tocky Mice

### Nr4a3-Tocky mice

Our toolkit's effectiveness is exemplified in a study of thymic T-cells from **Nr4a3-Tocky mice**. In this model, TCR signaling acts as a developmental trigger, influencing cell fate and maturation. By analyzing Timer progression in conjunction with multidimensional marker profiles, we decipher thymic T-cell development in an unprecedented manner using our novel multidimensional Timer approach.

### Bim KO Nr4a3-Tocky mice and Tocky-CCA Analysis

Furthermore, by examining high-dimensional flow cytometric data from Bim KO Nr4a3-Tocky miceâ€”mice with the **Bcl2l11 (Bim)** gene knocked out in the Nr4a3-Tocky strainâ€”we can highlight the Bim-dependent death of developing T-cells, marked by Timer maturation during negative selection.
