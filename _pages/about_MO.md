Dr Masahiro Ono is an immunologist specialising in T-cells. He is the inventor of the innovative "Timer-of-Cell-Kinetics-and-Activity" (Tocky) technique, which is revolutionising the study of T-cells and other immune cells, using Fluorescent Timer protein to analyse temporal changes of T-cell activitie in vivo.

His academic journey began at the prestigious Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto University, where he earned his MD (1993-1999) and subsequently specialized in dermatology. His passion for immunology was ignited during his PhD (2002-2006), focusing on regulatory T cells (Tregs), and the transcription factors Foxp3 and Runx1. 

Dr Ono's research took a significant leap forward in 2009 when he secured a Human Frontier Science Program (HFSP) Fellowship to join University College London (UCL). There, he broadened his research to encompass immunological genomics. His pioneering work earned him the BBSRC David Phillips Fellowship in 2012, allowing him to establish his laboratory at UCL. 

In 2015, Dr Ono brought his expertise to Imperial College London. He was promoted to Reader in Immunology in 2020. Dr Ono continues to lead groundbreaking research, mentoring the next generation of scientists and advancing our understanding of immune responses in health and disease using the Tocky technology.
