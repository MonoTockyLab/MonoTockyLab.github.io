    abstract={Understanding the temporal dynamics of T-cell transcription is crucial for insights into immune cell function and development. In this study, we show the features of the Timer-of-Cell-Kinetics-and-Activity (Tocky) system, which enables analysis of temporal dynamics of cell activities and differentiation, leveraging Fluorescent Timer protein, which spontaneously changes its emission spectrum from blue to red fluorescence in known kinetics, as reporters. The current study examines the properties of the Tocky system, highlighting the Timer-Angle approach, which is a core algorithm of Tocky analysis and converts Timer Blue and Red fluorescence into Timer Angle and Intensity by trigonometric transformation. Importantly, Tocky analyzes time-related events within individual cells by the two phases of measurements, distinguishing between (1) the temporal sequence of cellular activities and differentiation within the time domain, and (2) the transcription frequency within the frequency domain. The transition from time measurement to frequency analysis, particularly at the Persistent locus that bridges these domains, highlights that system’s unique property in what is measured and analyzed by Tocky. Intriguingly, the sustained transcriptional activities observed in cells at the Persistent locus may have unique biological features as demonstrated in activated regulatory T-cells (Treg) and pathogenic T-cells, respectively, using Foxp3-Tocky and Nr4a3-Tocky models. In conclusion, the Tocky system can provide crucial data for advancing our understanding of T-cell dynamics and function.},

This feature generates a wide variety of infected clones in hosts, which are maintained via clonal proliferation, resulting in the persistence and survival of the virus. The maintenance of the pool of infected cells is achieved by sculpting the immunophenotype of infected cells and modulating host immune responses to avoid immune surveillance. Here, we review the processes undertaken by HTLV-1 to modulate and subvert host immune responses which contributes to viral persistence and development of ATL.},

@article{RN91,
	abstract = {In lymphocytes, Nr4a gene expression is specifically regulated by antigen receptor signalling, making them ideal targets for use as distal T cell receptor (TCR) reporters. Nr4a3-Timer of cell kinetics and activity (Tocky) mice are a ground-breaking tool to report TCR-driven Nr4a3 expression using Fluorescent Timer protein (FT). FT undergoes a time-dependent shift in its emission spectrum following translation, allowing for the temporal reporting of transcriptional events. Our recent work suggested that Nr4a1/Nur77 may be a more sensitive gene to distal TCR signals compared to Nr4a3, so we, therefore, generated Nur77-Timer-rapidly-expressed-in-lymphocytes (Tempo) mice that express FT under the regulation of Nur77. We validated the ability of Nur77-Tempo mice to report TCR and B cell receptor signals and investigated the signals regulating Nur77-FT expression. We found that Nur77-FT was sensitive to low-strength TCR signals, and its brightness was graded in response to TCR signal strength. Nur77-FT detected positive selection signals in the thymus, and analysis of FT expression revealed that positive selection signals are often persistent in nature, with most thymic Treg expressing FT Blue. We found that active TCR signals in the spleen are low frequency, but CD69(+) lymphoid T cells are enriched for FT Blue(+) Red(+) T cells, suggesting frequent TCR signalling. In non-lymphoid tissue, we saw a dissociation of FT protein from CD69 expression, indicating that tissue residency is not associated with tonic TCR signals. Nur77-Tempo mice, therefore, combine the temporal dynamics from the Tocky innovation with increased sensitivity of Nr4a1 to lower TCR signal strengths.},

	abstract = {CD4 T-cells require T-cell receptor (TCR) signalling for their activation and differentiation. Foxp3+ regulatory T-cells (Treg) are dependent on TCR signals for their differentiation and suppressive function. However, it is not fully known how TCR signalling controls the differentiation of polyclonal CD4 T-cells upon antigen recognition at the single-cell level in vivo. In this study, using Nr4a3-Tocky (Timer-of-cell-kinetics-and-activity), which analyses temporal changes of antigen-reactive T-cells following TCR signalling, we investigated T-cell response to Spike protein fragments (S1a, S1b, S2a, and S2b) upon immunisation. We show that S1a and S2a induced the differentiation of PD1hiCXCR5+ T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, which is related to CD4 T-cell immunogenicity. In contrast, S1b induced CD25hiGITRhiPD-1int Treg, which intermittently received TCR signalling. Using Foxp3-Tocky, which analyses Foxp3 transcriptional dynamics, the S1b-reactive Treg sustained Foxp3 transcription over time, which is a hallmark of activated Treg. Foxp3 fate-mapping showed that the S1b-reactive Treg were derived not from pre-existing thymic Treg, suggesting Foxp3 induction in non-Treg cells. Thus, the current study reveals temporally dynamic differentiation of CD4 T-cells and Treg upon immunisation in the polyclonal TCR repertoire.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) mainly infects CD4+ T cells and induces chronic, persistent infection in infected individuals, with some developing adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL). HTLV-1 alters cellular differentiation, activation, and survival; however, it is unknown whether and how these changes contribute to the malignant transformation of infected cells. In this study, we used single-cell RNA-sequencing and T cell receptor--sequencing to investigate the differentiation and HTLV-1--mediated transformation of T cells. We analyzed 87,742 PBMCs from 12 infected and 3 uninfected individuals. Using multiple independent bioinformatics methods, we demonstrated the seamless transition of naive T cells into activated T cells, whereby HTLV-1--infected cells in an activated state further transformed into ATL cells, which are characterized as clonally expanded, highly activated T cells. Notably, the greater the activation state of ATL cells, the more they acquire Treg signatures. Intriguingly, the expression of HLA class II genes in HTLV-1--infected cells was uniquely induced by the viral protein Tax and further upregulated in ATL cells. Functional assays revealed that HTLV-1--infected cells upregulated HLA class II molecules and acted as tolerogenic antigen-presenting cells to induce anergy of antigen-specific T cells. In conclusion, our study revealed the in vivo mechanisms of HTLV-1--mediated transformation and immune escape at the single-cell level.},

	abstract = {Summary Foxp3+ T regulatory (Treg) cells promote immunological tumor tolerance, but how their immune-suppressive function is regulated in the tumor microenvironment (TME) remains unknown. Here, we used intravital microscopy to characterize the cellular interactions that provide tumor-infiltrating Treg cells with critical activation signals. We found that the polyclonal Treg cell repertoire is pre-enriched to recognize antigens presented by tumor-associated conventional dendritic cells (cDCs). Unstable cDC contacts sufficed to sustain Treg cell function, whereas T helper cells were activated during stable interactions. Contact instability resulted from CTLA-4-dependent downregulation of co-stimulatory B7-family proteins on cDCs, mediated by Treg cells themselves. CTLA-4-blockade triggered CD28-dependent Treg cell hyper-proliferation in the TME, and concomitant Treg cell inactivation was required to achieve tumor rejection. Therefore, Treg cells self-regulate through a CTLA-4- and CD28-dependent feedback loop that adjusts their population size to the amount of local co-stimulation. Its disruption through CTLA-4-blockade may off-set therapeutic benefits in cancer patients.},

    abstract = {Regulatory T cells (Treg) are negative regulators of the immune response; however, it is poorly understood whether and how Foxp3 transcription is induced and regulated in the periphery during T‐cell responses. Using Foxp3‐Timer of cell kinetics and activity (Tocky) mice, which report real‐time Foxp3 expression, we show that the flux of new Foxp3 expressors and the rate of Foxp3 transcription are increased during inflammation. These persistent dynamics of Foxp3 transcription determine the effector Treg programme and are dependent on a Foxp3 autoregulatory transcriptional circuit. Persistent Foxp3 transcriptional activity controls the expression of coinhibitory molecules, including CTLA‐4 and effector Treg signature genes. Using RNA‐seq, we identify two groups of surface proteins based on their relationship to the temporal dynamics of Foxp3 transcription, and we show proof of principle for the manipulation of Foxp3 dynamics by immunotherapy: new Foxp3 flux is promoted by anti‐TNFRII antibody, and high‐frequency Foxp3 expressors are targeted by anti‐OX40 antibody. Collectively, our study dissects time‐dependent mechanisms behind Foxp3‐driven T‐cell regulation and establishes the Foxp3‐Tocky system as a tool to investigate the mechanisms behind T‐cell immunotherapies.},

We establish a new tool, Timer of cell kinetics and activity (Tocky; or toki [time in Japanese]). Tocky uses the fluorescent Timer protein, which spontaneously shifts its emission spectrum from blue to red, in combination with computer algorithms to reveal the dynamics of differentiation in vivo. Using a transcriptional target of T cell receptor (TCR) signaling, we establish Nr4a3-Tocky to follow downstream effects of TCR signaling. Nr4a3-Tocky reveals the temporal sequence of events during regulatory T cell (Treg) differentiation and shows that persistent TCR signals occur during Treg generation. Remarkably, antigen-specific T cells at the site of autoimmune inflammation also show persistent TCR signaling. In addition, by generating Foxp3-Tocky, we reveal the in vivo dynamics of demethylation of the Foxp3 gene. Thus, Tocky is a tool for cell biologists to address previously inaccessible questions by directly revealing dynamic processes in vivo.},

This perspective is based on the key evidence that CD25+ Tregs emigrate to neonatal spleen a few days later than other T cells and that thymectomy of 3-day-old mice depletes Tregs only, causing autoimmune diseases. Although widely believed, the evidence has never been reproduced as originally reported, and some studies indicate that Tregs exist in neonates. Thus we examine the consequences of the controversial evidence, revisit the fundamental issues of Tregs and thereby reveal the overlooked relationship of T-cell activation and Foxp3-mediated control of the T-cell system. Here we provide a new model of Tregs and Foxp3, a feedback control perspective, which views Tregs as a component of the system that controls T-cell activation, rather than as a distinct genetically programmed lineage. This perspective provides new insights into the roles of self-reactivity, T cell–antigen-presenting cell interaction and T-cell activation in Foxp3-mediated immune regulation.},

    abstract = {CD4+ T cells that express the transcription factor FOXP3 (FOXP3+ T cells) are commonly regarded as immunosuppressive regulatory T cells (Tregs). FOXP3+ T cells are reported to be increased in tumor-bearing patients or animals and are considered to suppress antitumor immunity, but the evidence is often contradictory. In addition, accumulating evidence indicates that FOXP3 is induced by antigenic stimulation and that some non-Treg FOXP3+ T cells, especially memory-phenotype FOXP3low cells, produce proinflammatory cytokines. Accordingly, the subclassification of FOXP3+ T cells is fundamental for revealing the significance of FOXP3+ T cells in tumor immunity, but the arbitrariness and complexity of manual gating have complicated the issue. In this article, we report a computational method to automatically identify and classify FOXP3+ T cells into subsets using clustering algorithms. By analyzing flow cytometric data of melanoma patients, the proposed method showed that the FOXP3+ subpopulation that had relatively high FOXP3, CD45RO, and CD25 expressions was increased in melanoma patients, whereas manual gating did not produce significant results on the FOXP3+ subpopulations. Interestingly, the computationally identified FOXP3+ subpopulation included not only classical FOXP3high Tregs, but also memory-phenotype FOXP3low cells by manual gating. Furthermore, the proposed method successfully analyzed an independent data set, showing that the same FOXP3+ subpopulation was increased in melanoma patients, validating the method. Collectively, the proposed method successfully captured an important feature of melanoma without relying on the existing criteria of FOXP3+ T cells, revealing a hidden association between the T cell profile and melanoma, and providing new insights into FOXP3+ T cells and Tregs.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Currently, in the era of post-genomics, immunology is facing a challenging problem to translate mutant phenotypes into gene functions based on high-throughput data, while taking into account the classifications and functions of immune cells, which requires new methods. RESULTS: Here we propose a novel application of a multidimensional analysis, Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA), to reveal the molecular characteristics of undefined cells in terms of cellular differentiation programmes by analysing two transcriptomic datasets. Using two independent datasets, whether RNA-seq or microarray data, CCA successfully visualised the cross-level relationships between genes, cells, and differentiation programmes, and thereby identified the immunological features of mutant cells (Gata3-KO T cells and Stat3-KO T cells) in a data-oriented manner. With a new concept, differentiation variable, CCA provides an automatic classification of cell samples, which had a high sensitivity and a comparable performance to other classification methods. In addition, we elaborate how CCA results can be interpreted, and reveal the features of CCA in comparison with other visualisation techniques. CONCLUSIONS: CCA is a visualisation tool with a classification ability to reveal the cross-level relationships of genes, cells and differentiation programmes. This can be used for characterising the functional defect of cells of interest (e.g. mutant cells) in the context of cellular differentiation. The proposed approach fits with common hypothesis-oriented studies in immunology, and can be used for a wide range of molecular and genomic studies on cellular differentiation mechanisms.},

	abstract = {The understanding of pathological processes is based on the comparison between physiological and pathological conditions, and transcriptomic analysis has been extensively applied to various diseases for this purpose. However, the way in which the transcriptomic data of pathological cells relate to the transcriptomes of normal cellular counterparts has not been fully explored, and may provide new and unbiased insights into the mechanisms of these diseases. To achieve this, it is necessary to develop a method to simultaneously analyse components across different levels, namely genes, normal cells, and diseases. Here we propose a multidimensional method that visualises the cross-level relationships between these components at three different levels based on transcriptomic data of physiological and pathological processes, by adapting Canonical Correspondence Analysis, which was developed in ecology and sociology, to microarray data (CCA on Microarray data, CCAM). Using CCAM, we have analysed transcriptomes of haematological disorders and those of normal haematopoietic cell differentiation. First, by analysing leukaemia data, CCAM successfully visualised known relationships between leukaemia subtypes and cellular differentiation, and their characteristic genes, which confirmed the relevance of CCAM. Next, by analysing transcriptomes of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), we have shown that CCAM was effective in both generating and testing hypotheses. CCAM showed that among MDS patients, high-risk patients had transcriptomes that were more similar to those of both haematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors (MEP) than low-risk patients, and provided a prognostic model. Collectively, CCAM reveals hidden relationships between pathological and physiological processes and gene expression, providing meaningful clinical insights into haematological diseases, and these could not be revealed by other univariate and multivariate methods. Furthermore, CCAM was effective in identifying candidate genes that are correlated with cellular phenotypes of interest. We expect that CCAM will benefit a wide range of medical fields.},

	abstract = {The CTLA-4 pathway is a key regulator of T cell activation and a critical failsafe against autoimmunity. Although early models postulated that CTLA-4 transduced a negative signal, in vivo evidence suggests that CTLA-4 functions in a cell-extrinsic manner. That multiple cell-intrinsic mechanisms have been attributed to CTLA-4, yet its function in vivo appears to be cell-extrinsic, has been an ongoing paradox in the field. Although CTLA-4 expressed on conventional T cells (Tconv) can mediate inhibitory function, it is unclear why this fails to manifest as an intrinsic effect. In this study, we show that Tconv-expressed CTLA-4 can function in a cell-extrinsic manner in vivo. CTLA-4(+/+) T cells, from DO11/rag(-/-) mice that lack regulatory T cells, were able to regulate the response of CTLA-4(-/-) T cells in cotransfer experiments. This observation provides a potential resolution to the above paradox and suggests CTLA-4 function on both Tconv and regulatory T cells can be achieved through cell-extrinsic mechanisms.},

This is naturally puzzling since real systems are composed of a finite number of particles; consequently, a well&#x2010;known reaction to this problem was to urge that the thermodynamic definition of phase transitions (in terms of singularities) should not be &#x201c;taken seriously.&#x201d; This article takes singularities seriously and analyzes their role by using the well&#x2010;known distinction between data and phenomena, in an attempt to better understand the origin of the puzzle.]},
