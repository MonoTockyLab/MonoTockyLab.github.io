#### Masahiro Ono launched his innovative project to develop a completely new methodology to analyse the time domain of T cell activities using a Fluorescent Timer protein - **T**imer-**o**f-**c**ell-**k**inetics-and-activit**y** (**Tocky**) in 2013. This resulted in a [seminal publication](https://rupress.org/jcb/article/217/8/2931/39442/A-timer-for-analyzing-temporally-dynamic-changes) in 2018 {% cite RN55 %}.

Nr4a3-Tocky T cells, activated by TCR stimulation, exhibit initial timer blue fluorescence within the first hours, which then gradually matures into red fluorescence. This transition approaches the diagonal line between the Blue and Red axes, indicating protein maturation.

Tocky is a technology transforming our understanding of the immune system by tracking T cells' activity over time. This method, which uses a color-changing protein, has illuminated the path of T cell activation and differentiation, providing new insights into autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis. "Tocky" represents not just a milestone in immunology research but a beacon guiding us toward novel therapeutic horizons. It's a testament to the power of innovation in revealing the hidden dynamics of life at the cellular level.

The publication was featured in the journal's collection [*Stem Cells and Development 2019*](https://rupress.org/jcb/collection/41/Stem-Cells-and-Development-2019).
